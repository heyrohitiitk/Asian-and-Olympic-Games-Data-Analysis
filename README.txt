Project Title :- Data Analysis of Asian and Olympics Games

We have created 6 folders namely Datasets,Jupyter Notebooks,Presentation,Project Report,Streamlit Files,Web Scraping.

The files that we have included are :- CSV files are in Datasets folder,
                                       15 ipynb notebooks are in Jupyter Notebooks folder, 
                                       main.py and helper.py are in Streamlit Files folder,
                                       report(pdf) is in Project Report folder and 
                                       presentation(ppt) is in Presentation folder,
                                       Web Scraping folder contains the jupyter notebooks in which we have written code to scrape the data.

The libraries that we have used to work on the project:-

1):- Numpy :- For performing arithmetic operations(Please install numpy by running the command "pip install numpy", if you do not have it installed)
2):- Pandas :- For Datasets handling(Please install pandas by running the command "pip install pandas", if you do not have it installed)
3):- Matplotlib :- For plotting graphs and visualizations(Please install matplotlib by running the command "pip install matplotlib", if you do not have 
                   it installed)
4):- Seaborn :- For plotting graphs and visualizations(Please install seaborn by running the command "pip install seaborn", if you do not have it installed)
5):- Streamlit :- We have used this library to make website for better analysis and visualization of our project.(Please install streamlit by running the 
                  command "pip install streamlit", if you do not have it installed)

Make sure that you have latest version of python, so that all the above mentioned libraries/dependancies run smoothly.

Description about each file:-

Datasets :-

1):- Medal_List_Asian.csv : This file contains info about the number of medals won country wise and sports wise in Asian Games.

3):- Player_Medal_List_Asian : This file contains info about players that won medals sports wise in Asian games.
4):- Player_Medal_List_Olympics : This file contains info about players that won medals sports wise in Olympics games.

Code Files:- 

1):- main.py : This file contains the code that we have written inorder to design the frontend of our website and also in this file we have imported the 
               helper.py.
2):- helper.py : This file contains the different functions that we have implemented in our project.
3):- Q1.ipynb : In this file we have written the code that performs the analysis of medal counts of different countries and different years.
4):- Q2.ipynb : In this file we have written the code that performs the analysis of percentage medals won by different countries in different years and 
                overall.
5):- Q3.ipynb : In this file we have written the code that performs the analysis of number of medals won by countries sports wise and overall.
6):- Q4.ipynb : In this file we have written the code that performs the analysis of number of medals won by countries as host and non-host countries.
7):- Q5.ipynb : In this file we have written the code that determines the top athletes in terms of number of medals won for each country.
8):- Q6.ipynb : In this file we have written the code that determines the top athlete sports wise for each country.
9):- Q7.ipynb : In this file we have written the code that performs the gender wise analysis of number of medals won by countries in each year and overall.
10):- Q8.ipynb : In this file we have written the code that performs the analysis of number of medals won by countries in team sports vs individual sports.
11):- Q9.ipynb : In this file we have written the code that performs the analysis of the athletes that won medal in asian games and also in immediate next
                  olympic games.
12):- Q10.ipynb : In this file we have written the code that performs the detailed analysis of countries and players who never won a medal
                   (Gold,silver or bronze) and also analysis of players who won in Asian but not in Olympics and vice versa. 
13):- Q11.ipynb : In this file we have written the code that performs the detailed analysis of India in both Asian and Olympic games.
14):- Q12.ipynb : In this file we have written the code that determines the players who won medals in both Asian and Olympic games.
15):- Q13.ipynb : In this file we have written the code that finds the countries that have won atleast one medal in every sport in a particular year.
16):- Q14.ipynb : In this file we have written the code that finds Recession year for a country(i.e. Country that perform better initially but after some 
                  time its performance drops).
17):- Q15.ipynb : In this file we have written the code that finds year or sport in which country won minimum(maximum) medals(gold,silver,bronze separately).

We have used Streamlit to build a website and have also deployed our code. 
Here is the link to our website :- https://share.streamlit.io/divyansh009/dmprojectgrp10/main/main.py

If you wish to look at the analysis by running our code in a local host, then do the same by running the command "streamlit run main.py" by making 
"g10-project" as the working directory.
